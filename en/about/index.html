<h1>About me</h1>

<p>		
  Great that you found your way to my website! I use this little blog to publish articles on a regularly unregular basis. Topics vary strongly according to my interests. But let me give you a few information about me.
</p>

<h2>Profession</h2>
<p>
  My name is Michael Schaefer. Currently I am employed at <a href="http://www.uni-muenster.de">M&uuml;nster University</a> as a scientific assistent at the <a href="http://wwwmath.uni-muenster.de/num/">Institute for Computational and Applied Mathematics</a>. I work this partial differential equations or parametrized multiscale equations, to be precise. The main focus of my work is model reduction and parameter optimization for those equations. An important part is the implementation of numerical algorithms suited for these problems.
</p>

<h2>Private life</h2>
<p>
  One of my hobbies is playing the piano. In my youth I played for about six years. Two years ago I decided to buy me an electric piano. Since then I take lessons again once a week.
