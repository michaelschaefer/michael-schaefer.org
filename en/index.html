	Great that you found your way to <a href="/en/about/">my</a> website! I use this little blog to publish articles on a regularly unregular basis. Topics vary strongly according to my interests. This mainpage always includes a list of the three most recently published articles. That way you can see quickly if there is something new.<br/>
	A note about the handling: With the three half circle shaped buttons at the very top you can switch the language (left and right) and hide resp. show the banner (middle).
