<h1>Welcome on www.michael-schaefer.org</h1>

<p>
	Great that you found your way to <a href="/en/about/">my</a> website! I use this little blog to publish articles on a regularly unregular basis. Topics vary strongly according to my interests. This mainpage always includes a list of the three most recently published articles. That way you can see quickly if there is something new.
</p>

<p>
	<em>Just so much for the usage of the website:</em> The navigation bar at the top can be used to (from left to right) open a side menu, go back to the mainpage, view the archive, have a look at the tag list, show a page with information about myself and call the imprint. The side menu includes a short profile of me and a language switcher.
</p>

<p>
	<em>Privacy note:</em> I use <a href="http://www.disqus.com">disqus</a> to provide a commentary function. Anyone how creates an account there has to live with the related privacy issues. That in mind, I exclicitely allow to comment as a guest (thus without registration).
</p>

<p>
	Have a lot of fun on my website!
