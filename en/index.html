<h1>Welcome on www.michael-schaefer.org</h1>

<p>
	Great that you found your way to <a href="/en/about/">my</a> website! I use this little blog to publish articles on a regularly unregular basis. Topics vary strongly according to my interests. This mainpage always includes a list of the three most recently published articles. That way you can see quickly if there is something new.
</p>

<p>
	Just so much for the usage of the website: The navigation bar at the top can be used to (from left to right) open a side menu, go back to the mainpage, show a page with information about myself, have a look at the tag list and call the imprint. The side menu includes a short profile of me, language switcher, a short version of the tag list and an archive.
</p>

<p>
	Have a lot of fun on my website!
